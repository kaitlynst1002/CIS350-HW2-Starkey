# CIS350-HW2-Starkey

## Kaitlyn Starkey's Interests
- I really enjoy learning about the encryption/decryption process, as well risk management 
- When programming I like to code something that will be useful in my career 
- I am interested in researching/learning about how code can be exploited by users
  
### Technical Background
- I have taken Computer Science 1 and 2, which has taught me intermediate java. Java is the only language that I have coded multiple projects in and I am comfortable working with. This semester I am learning C and Python but I do not know enough to code a project in those languages. I have very little technical experience due to switching to a STEM major just last year in Fall 2019. After graduation I am not looking for a developer postition but more something that envolves information security.
